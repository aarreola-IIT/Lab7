# Lab 07: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to
find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do 
for this lab is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists 
of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first 
page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly 
ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your 
own master usability checklist.

## Individual Deliverables To Basecamp:
